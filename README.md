## Developing

To start developing, simply `git clone` and `npm install` the app on your local computer:

`$ git clone https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr.git`\
`$ cd Zettlr`\
`$ yarn install`\
`$ cd source`\
`$ yarn install`

_(Please note the second `yarn install` in the source directory. This is necessary if you want to build the app locally.)_

If you use `npm`, this is also supported.

To explore the functionality and inner workings of the app, [head over to our development documentation!](http://dev.zettlr.com/api/)

**Before your first `yarn start`** and everytime you've made changes to either the `LESS`-files or the templates, you need to run:

`$ yarn less`\
`$ yarn handlebars`

to compile both the style sheets and the precompiled `handlebars.js` templates. (If you are using `npm`, the command is `npm run less`, etc.)
